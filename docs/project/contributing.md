# Contribution process

## Getting started
After familiarizing yourself with the documentation, the simplest way to get started is to:
1. Join the `#feast-development` [Slack channel](https://tectonfeast.slack.com/archives/C01NTDB88QK), where contributors discuss ideas and PRs
2. Join our Google Groups in order to get access to RFC folders + get invites to community calls.
3. Setup your developer environment by following [development guide](development-guide.md). 
4. Either create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/issues) or make a draft PR (following [development guide](development-guide.md)) to get the ball rolling!

We follow a process of [lazy consensus](http://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html). If you believe you know what the project needs then just start development. As long as there is no active opposition and the PR has been approved by maintainers or CODEOWNERS, contributions will be merged.

## Decision making process

We use our `#feast-development` [Slack channel](https://tectonfeast.slack.com/archives/C01NTDB88QK),  [GitHub issues + PRs](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/issues) to communicate development ideas. The simplest way to contribute to Feast is to leave comments in our [RFCs](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1msUsgmDbVBaysmhBlg9lklYLLTMk4bC3) in the [Feast Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AAe8j7ZK3sxSUk9PVA) or our GitHub issues. 

You will need to join our Google Groups in order to get access to the folders + get invites to community calls. See [community](../community.md) for more details.

## Pull requests

Please [submit a PR](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/pulls) to the master branch of the Feast repository once you are ready to submit your contribution. Code submission to Feast \(including submission from project maintainers\) require review and approval from maintainers or code owners.

PRs that are submitted by the general public need to be identified as `ok-to-test`. Once enabled, [Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow) will run a range of tests to verify the submission, after which community members will help to review the pull request.

See also [Making a pull request](development-guide.md#making-a-pull-request) for other guidelines on making pull requests in Feast.
